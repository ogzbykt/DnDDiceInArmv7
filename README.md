# DnDDiceInArmv7
This was the final project for my Microprocessors Class.

To run this project you can use CPUlator. Here is a link to the site:
https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc

Armv7-De1-SoC is the system used for this assembly code.

How it works:
You choose a dice using switches. Number of switches active determine the dice type.
1-d4
2-d6
3-d8
4-d10
5-d12
6-d20

Then, to get a result you need to push and release any of the Push buttons.
The result will display on the Seven-segment displays.
